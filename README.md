# XSLT-test-task
Write xslt-template that converts the source XML in the resulting XML, in which &lt;math> elements will be numbered (attribute number must be added) in ascending order, taking into account the final location where &lt;feature> elements will take the place of &lt;featureAnchor> with the corresponding id.
